Monotonic Array

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is monotonic if its elements (from left to right) are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

Note: empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.

INPUT
array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]

OUTPUT
true
