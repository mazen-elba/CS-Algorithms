Nth Fibonacci

Note: Fibonacci sequence is defined as: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the Nth number is the sum of the (N-1)th and (N-2)th numbers (ie; F[0] = 0, F[1] = 1, F[N] = sum(F[N-1] + F[N-2])).

Write a function that takes an integer N and returns the Nth Fibonacci number.

INPUT
N = 6

OUTPUT
5 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
