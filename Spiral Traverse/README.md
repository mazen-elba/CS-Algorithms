Spiral Traverse

Write a function that takes in an N x M two-dimensional array (squared or not squared) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order.

Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

INPUT
array = [
[1, 2, 3, 4],
[12, 13, 14, 5],
[11, 16, 15, 6],
[10, 9, 8, 7],
]

OUTPUT
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
